## Translation instructions

1. Download this package (ZIP button above).
2. Unzip the package and find the .po and .mo files for your theme and language.
3. Create a `/includes` directory within your theme directory or your pro child theme directory and copy the .po and .mo files into that directory.
4. Define the language in your `wp-config.php` file.

### Create your own translation file

All of our themes include a `.po` file. The file may be used with a program like [poEdit](http://www.poedit.net/) to generate a set of translation files for the theme in your language.
